1. Unverified Signature
 --->  change content/ signature not verified by server
2. None algorithm attack
 ---> check none, NONE,None etc
3. Brute force secret key in symmetric algorithm
4. Use jwk header
 ---> Use Burpsuite extension for attack
5. Use jku header
 ---> Use Burpsuite extension for attack
6. Using kid header paramater
 ---> if kid points to any file in the system wecan use /dev/null as kid and sign the key using empty string '' or contents of any file we just
      have to give the location of the file in kid paramter
